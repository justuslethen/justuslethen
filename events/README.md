Events is a service for anyone who wants to host an event and create their plan online.

### Create an event
Click on the plus icon in the top right corner to create your subevents, set a PIN, name the event, and customize your event plan. Then just click the save button — and that’s it.

### View an event
The list of created events is public, but the events themselves are private if a PIN is configured. You can enter the PIN to gain access to the event, and access will remain available on this device for a lifetime.

### Tokens
Every device saves a token as a cookie once an event is opened.
Each time you open a public event or a PIN-protected event for the first time, the permissions for this token are saved and will be checked every time you open the event again.
