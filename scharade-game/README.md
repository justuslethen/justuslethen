# Scharade

Scharade is a **party game** where two or more teams compete against each other.

At the start, players add words to a shared list—ideally nouns or verbs—to ensure a fun and challenging game.

On each turn, one player from a team picks a word (or is assigned one) and must describe it to their teammates without saying the word itself. The team must guess the word as quickly as possible. The player can use gestures, synonyms, or indirect descriptions, but depending on the rules, they might be restricted from using certain types of clues.

Once the timer runs out, it’s the other team’s turn.

After every word has been guessed at least once—regardless of which team guessed it—you can start a second round with modified rules for added difficulty. For example:
- Players can only use one word to describe the given word.
- Players must imitate the word using only sounds.
- Players must act out the word without speaking (like in classic Charades).


The game continues for as many rounds as you have configed!
