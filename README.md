## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Justus

Iâ€™m 16 years old and live in Hamm, Germany, near MÃ¼nster. I love writing small programs just for fun or creating tools that my friends and I actually need â€” especially when I believe I can build a simpler, free version of them.

I started by writing small websites in HTML and CSS. Then, I learned JavaScript to run small programs on the frontend. Later, I learned the basics of Python and started building Flask web apps.

Some projects I started were never finishedâ€”but some were.

In the last two months, I started using React as the frontend framework for my web apps.

# What will this repository be used for

In this repository, I will add every project that is already deployed on justuslethen.de or that I plan to deploy there.

Most of these are small web app tools for me and my friends.

At the moment, I specialize in building Flask and SocketIO web services.
In the future, I plan to learn Go, specifically for my learn-cards web app, to develop an algorithm that finds the perfect card to study at any given moment.
